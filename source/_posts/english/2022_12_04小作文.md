作为这所大学的一名大四学生，我特别喜欢在空闲时间在这所图书馆读书，我写这封信的目的是为改善这里的服务提出建议。  
  
首先，与学生的学习需求相比，书籍的数量和种类都不够。因此，购买更多最新/新书是明智的。此外，由于包括我在内的许多学生都在为研究生入学考试做准备，你应该延长他们学习的阅览室的开放时间。  
  
最后，我想说，我非常感谢你的辛勤工作，因为正是你的敬业精神使我们能够在这里享受积极的学习氛围。（最后，我代表所有学生，非常感谢您的辛勤工作，因为正是您的敬业精神使我们能够在这里享受到积极的学习氛围。|我相信，通过我们的共同努力，图书馆服务将得到很大改善。）

  Plastic bags, to my understanding , are characterized by the damage to the environment.However, compared with other regions, our city is suffering more server "White pollution" since restrications on the ues of plastic bags have not been as successful as expected (= restrications on the use of plastic bags have not been as successful in out city). Accordingly, is is advisable for your to specitfically report the harm of "White Pollution".Meanwhile, for the purpose of educationg readers to replace plastic bags with cloth pr paper ones, you are supposed to dsign certain simple but enlighenting pictures and port them on your newspaper.  
  I deem that with put shared efforts, "White Pollution" can be alleviated and even be eliminated.  
  Yours sincerely,

尊敬的先生/女士：，  
  
作为贵报的忠实读者，我非常关注环境保护，我写信是想就“白色污染”提出建议。  
  
据我了解，塑料袋的特点是对环境的破坏。然而，与其他地区相比，我市遭受的“白色污染”更严重，因为对塑料袋使用的限制并不像预期的那样成功（=在外地对塑料袋的使用的限制没有成功）。因此，建议您具体报告“白色污染”的危害。同时，为了教育读者用布包或纸包来代替塑料袋，你应该在一些简单但有启发性的图片上签名，并将它们贴在报纸上。  
  
我认为，通过共同努力，“白色污染”可以得到缓解，甚至可以消除。  
  
谨上，
